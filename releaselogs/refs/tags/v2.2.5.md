# News added in JuBiter SDKã€€v2.2.5:
+ Fixing the bug of scp11c's implements, added or modified functions as below, see 'JUB_SDK_COMM.h'/'JUB_SDK_DEV_NFC.h':
  + JUB_ParseDeviceCert()
  + JUB_initNFCDevice()
  

JUB_ParseDeviceCert() is used to parse the certificate and returns the certificate's serial number and subjectID, where the certificate serial number is used to compare with the current device serial number, in order to determine whether the certificate matches the current device. For Lite, subjectID is used for NFC_DEVICE_INIT_PARAM, see JUB_initNFCDevice() for detail.
