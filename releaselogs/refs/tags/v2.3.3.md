# News added in Jubiter SDK v2.3.3:
+ Added new function for TRX as below, see 'JUB_SDK_TRX.h':
  + JUB_SetTRC10Asset()

Note: To facilitate the display of the asset units, you need to register the asset information with the applet through this function. It should be noted that this function is registered before calling JUB_SignTransactionTRX() for TRC-10 transactions, and no other APDU directives should be inserted between JUB_SetTRC10Asset() and JUB_SignTransactionTRX().
