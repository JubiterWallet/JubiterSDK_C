# News added in JuBiter SDKã€€v2.2.4:
+ Supports signing contract for ETH, added functions as below, see 'JUB_SDK_ETH.h':
  + JUB_SignContractETH()

This function is compatible with support for signing ERC-20. It means that you can call both JUB_SignTransactionETH & JUB_SignContractETH for signing ERC-20.
