# News added in JuBiter SDKã€€v2.2.7:
  + To fix the bug of COS support EOS, modified functions as below, see 
  'JubiterBladeEOSImpl.cpp' -> SelectApplet()
  
  + JUB_CreateContextEOS()
  
  The method need to get the version of COS first,  and then send the COS version to the applet after switching to EOS.
