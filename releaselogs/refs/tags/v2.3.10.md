# News added in Jubiter SDK v2.3.10:
+ Supports ERC1155 done, added functions as below, see 'JUB_SDK_ETH.h':
+ JUB_BuildERC1155TransferAbiETH()
+ JUB_BuildERC1155BatchTransferAbiETH()

Note: ERC1155 is an extension of ERC721, so using the same interface as ERC721's for  ERC1155 to set NFToken information, that is, JUB_SetERC721TokenETH().

-------------------
+ ’test‘ can be used as an internal test tool.
